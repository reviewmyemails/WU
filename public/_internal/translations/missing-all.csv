quiz.reality_noconsent,quiz,"We catch invalid addresses, spam traps, role accounts, and high-risk patterns that other validators miss. We're thorough. But we're also honest: no tool can catch every trap on a non-consent list because some are designed to be undetectable. That's true for every validator—we're just the ones who tell you.",
quiz.reality_crisis,quiz,"You need a remediation strategy, not just a clean list. I help identify the root cause and build a path back to good standing with your ESP.",
quiz.reality_toolfailure,quiz,"Automated tools cannot see behavioral history. They check code, not context. I find the 'Valid but Dangerous' addresses they miss.",
quiz.reality_infra,quiz,"Domain authentication tells inbox providers you are who you say you are. Without it, your emails look suspicious regardless of list quality.",
quiz.reality_catchall,quiz,A large percentage of business domains are catch-all. Validation marks them 'Unknown' because it cannot verify. Pattern recognition and engagement history tell a different story.,
quiz.reality_decay,quiz,"This is the hardest problem to diagnose because there is no event. Your list has accumulated decay, and it is dragging down your engaged subscribers.",
quiz.reality_preventive,quiz,You are doing the right things. A safety check ensures you do not accidentally hit a trap that did not exist last time you sent.,
