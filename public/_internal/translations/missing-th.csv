quiz.result_noconsent_subhead,quiz,Lists without explicit consent carry more risk—but that doesn't mean you can't send safely. We'll remove the addresses most likely to hurt you.
quiz.result_crisis_subhead,quiz,An ESP warning is the final straw. Your reputation is already damaged. Automated cleaning alone will not get you reinstated.
quiz.result_toolfailure_subhead,quiz,You paid for syntax checking. You were punished for reputation. A 'Valid' email can still be a spam trap or chronic complainer.
quiz.result_infra_subhead,quiz,"Without proper DMARC authentication, even a clean list can land in spam. This is a fixable issue, but it needs attention before list cleaning matters."
quiz.result_catchall_subhead,quiz,Catch-all domains accept everything. Validation tools cannot tell you which addresses are real. I can.
quiz.result_decay_subhead,quiz,No bounce spike. No warning. Just a quiet decline as dead weight accumulates and inbox providers filter you to spam.
quiz.result_preventive_subhead,quiz,Healthy lists still decay by about 22% every year. A preventative review before a big send catches recycled traps that formed since your last campaign.
quiz.reality_noconsent,quiz,"We catch invalid addresses, spam traps, role accounts, and high-risk patterns that other validators miss. We're thorough. But we're also honest: no tool can catch every trap on a non-consent list because some are designed to be undetectable. That's true for every validator—we're just the ones who tell you."
quiz.reality_crisis,quiz,"You need a remediation strategy, not just a clean list. I help identify the root cause and build a path back to good standing with your ESP."
quiz.reality_toolfailure,quiz,"Automated tools cannot see behavioral history. They check code, not context. I find the 'Valid but Dangerous' addresses they miss."
quiz.reality_infra,quiz,"Domain authentication tells inbox providers you are who you say you are. Without it, your emails look suspicious regardless of list quality."
quiz.reality_catchall,quiz,A large percentage of business domains are catch-all. Validation marks them 'Unknown' because it cannot verify. Pattern recognition and engagement history tell a different story.
quiz.reality_decay,quiz,"This is the hardest problem to diagnose because there is no event. Your list has accumulated decay, and it is dragging down your engaged subscribers."
quiz.reality_preventive,quiz,You are doing the right things. A safety check ensures you do not accidentally hit a trap that did not exist last time you sent.
