## 2026-01-16 — Priority 1: Fix Critical Contradictions

Date: 2026-01-16

Decision: Fix 4 critical contradictions across website copy

Context:

Site audit revealed contradictions that hurt trust and confuse visitors:
1. Homepage says platform "almost here" but Pricing shows live pricing
2. Affiliate page targets "cold emailers" but Product Truth says we don't market to them
3. Shelly Mateer testimonial on SOS page has Pending permission
4. Denise H. testimonial on Homepage not in Proof Library

Agents consulted:

• Product Strategist – Green light. Contradictions must be fixed. No risks identified.
• Conversion Architect – Approved. Current state losing visitors who want to buy today.
• Brand Guardian – Approved all replacement copy. No hype. Translation-friendly.
• Technical Reality – Confirmed done-for-you is available now. Claims accurate.
• Proof Validator – Confirmed Shelly Mateer (Pending) and Denise H. (not in library) cannot be used. Approved Julia S and Megan S as replacements.

Founder call:

• Final decision: Approved
• Constraints added:
  - Do not touch anchor.reviewmyemails.com flow/logic
  - Remove 15,000 credits bonus (no launch gimmicks)
  - Text changes only, no design/layout changes
  - Anchor site out of scope for this phase

Risks accepted:

• If self-serve launches fully soon, copy needs updating again
• Dual CTAs (done-for-you + waitlist) could still cause some hesitation

Expected outcome:

• Visitors understand what's available NOW vs. coming
• Done-for-you service gets more inquiries
• Trust increases with approved testimonials
• No more positioning contradictions

Metrics to watch:

• Done-for-you inquiries
• Waitlist signups
• SOS Hotline emails
• Bounce rate on Homepage and Pricing

## 2026-01-16 — Structure Decision: How It Works Format

Date: 2026-01-16

Decision: "How It Works" will be a section on Home, not a standalone page

Context:

Site audit identified missing explanation of done-for-you vs. self-serve. Three options considered:
- A) Full standalone page
- B) Section on Home
- C) Hybrid (short section on Home + deep page)

Agents consulted:

• Conversion Architect – Recommended C (Hybrid). Serves both skimmers and detail-seekers.
• Founder Filter – Recommended B (Section on Home). Minimum maintenance, low workload.
• Product Strategist – Recommended A (Standalone page). Best for product clarity.

No 2-agent agreement. Decision escalated to founder.

Founder call:

• Final decision: B (Section on Home)
• Why: Founder Filter logic wins. Minimum pages, low maintenance. Can expand to Hybrid later if data shows problems.

Risks accepted:

• Detail-seekers may bounce if section is too light
• Home page gets longer
• May need to upgrade to Hybrid (C) later

Expected outcome:

• Visitors understand done-for-you vs. self-serve from Home
• Lower maintenance burden
• Faster iteration if changes needed

Metrics to watch:

• Confusion questions via SOS
• SOS emails asking about process
• Bounce rate before CTA on Home

Upgrade trigger:

If metrics show confusion, upgrade to Hybrid (C) — add standalone page.

## 2026-01-16 — Structure Decision: Why We're Different Page

Date: 2026-01-16

Decision: Merge "Why We're Different" into Home → How It Works section. Delete standalone page.

Context:

"Why We're Different" exists as standalone page but is not in primary nav. Low visibility, content wasted. Key differentiators should appear where visitors make buying decisions.

Agents consulted:

• Conversion Architect – Recommended B (Merge, delete page). Differentiators in context strengthen value proposition.
• Founder Filter – Recommended B (Merge, delete page). One less page to maintain.
• Product Strategist – Recommended B (Merge, delete page). Key message belongs on Home, not buried.

3/3 agent agreement on B.

Founder call:

• Final decision: Approved (B)
• Constraints added:
  - Keep as short blocks, not long paragraphs
  - Each point must support a buying decision
  - Use simple, translation-friendly language
  - Do not introduce new claims outside Product Truth / Proof Library
  - Add redirect from old page URL to Home

Key points to merge into How It Works section:

• Human review, not just automation
• Keep / Monitor / Suppress system (not binary valid/invalid)
• Clear explanations with every result
• Access to real deliverability experts

Risks accepted:

• Home section gets denser
• SEO value lost if old page had inbound links (unlikely)

Expected outcome:

• Differentiators appear in conversion context
• One less page to maintain
• Clearer value proposition on Home

Metrics to watch:

• Time on Home page
• CTA clicks from Home

## 2026-01-16 — Structure Decision: About Page Depth

Date: 2026-01-16

Decision: Create minimal About page

Context:

Website Conversion Blueprint lists About as core page. Product Truth says founder credibility is non-negotiable. Question: how much content?

Options considered:
- A) Full About page (story, philosophy, timeline)
- B) Minimal About page (photo, short bio, credentials)
- C) No About page (info woven elsewhere)

Agents consulted:

• Conversion Architect – Recommended B (Minimal). Trust signal without forcing visitors to read.
• Founder Filter – Recommended B (Minimal). 80% trust benefit with 20% work.
• Product Strategist – Recommended B (Minimal). Credibility required, biography not required.

3/3 agent agreement on B.

Founder call:

• Final decision: Approved (B)
• Constraints added:
  - Photo
  - Short bio (2-3 sentences)
  - Key credentials and awards
  - 1 light personal signal max (martial arts or multilingual)
  - No long story
  - No timeline
  - No philosophy essay
  - Must support trust and buying decisions
  - Keep translation friendly

Page contents:

• Photo of YT
• Bio: 2-3 sentences on role and expertise
• Awards: Best Business Award (2022), Top 100 Marketing & Advertising Leaders (2021), Litmus Coach Award (2020)
• Personal signal: 5th Dan Black Belt or multilingual (pick one)

Risks accepted:

• Less emotional connection than full story
• May feel sparse compared to competitors

Expected outcome:

• Trust box checked
• Low maintenance
• Supports buying decision without overhead

Metrics to watch:

• About page visits
• Return to Home from About

## 2026-01-16 — Structure Decision: Affiliate Program

Date: 2026-01-16

Decision: Keep Affiliate page but simplify to email-based referral

Context:

Affiliate page exists in footer. Founder actively sends people to it. Not found organically. Will eventually be in-app. Current page has placeholder text and implies automated tracking systems that don't exist.

Options considered:
- A) Keep as-is
- B) Keep but simplify (email-based, no forms/tracking)
- C) Pause/hide until actively recruiting

Agents consulted:

• Conversion Architect – Recommended A or B. Page doesn't hurt primary conversion, catches partner audience.
• Founder Filter – Recommended C unless actively recruiting. But founder confirmed active use.
• Product Strategist – Recommended B. Keep door open, simplify to match reality.

2/3 agreement on B (with founder context overriding Founder Filter concern).

Founder call:

• Final decision: Approved (B) — Keep but simplify
• Context: Founder actively sends people to this page. Not organic discovery.
• Constraints added:
  - No forms
  - No tracking promises
  - No complex systems
  - Email-based partnership only
  - Clear expectations
  - Fix all placeholder text
  - Remove anything that implies automation
  - No hype
  - No "program" language

Rewrite goals:

• Simple referral explanation
• Who it is for
• What they get
• How to start (email only)

Risks accepted:

• Less "professional" than competitors with full affiliate portals
• Manual tracking required

Expected outcome:

• Page matches reality
• Clear expectations for partners
• Low maintenance

Metrics to watch:

• Partner inquiries via email
• Successful referrals (manual tracking)
