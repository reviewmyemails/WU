## Page Title

SOS Deliverability Hotline

---

## Section 1: What This Is

**Heading:**
SOS Deliverability Hotline

**Subheading:**
Free expert guidance for anyone with an email question.

**Body:**
If you have a question about email deliverability, authentication, list quality, or strategy, this is where you ask it.

The SOS Hotline is a free service from Review My Emails. No sales pitch. No catch. Just honest answers from someone who has seen it all.

**CTA:**
Email the SOS Hotline →

## Section 2: Who This Is For

**Heading:**
Who This Is For

**Body:**
Anyone with an email question.

You do not need to be a client. You do not need to buy anything.

Common reasons people reach out:

- Open rates dropped and you do not know why
- ESP sent a warning and you are unsure what to do
- Bounces are rising
- You got blocklisted
- You are migrating ESPs and want a sanity check
- Your boss wants to email everyone and you know it is risky
- You need help explaining deliverability risks internally
- You are new to email and need direction

If it is about email, we can help.

## Section 3: How It Works

**Heading:**
How It Works

**Body:**
1. You send an email to the SOS Hotline
2. You receive an automatic reply confirming we got it
3. YT personally reads and responds within 72 hours

That is it. No forms. No booking system. Just email.

**Email address:**
ahoy@reviewmyemails.com

**CTA:**
Email the SOS Hotline →

## Section 4: What We Can Help With

## Section 5: What We Cannot Help With

**Heading:**
What We Do Not Do

**Body:**
We do not:

We cannot control spam filters or blocklist decisions. We can only help you understand what is happening and what to do about it.

## Section 6: Social Proof

**Heading:**
What People Say

**Testimonial 1:**
"The SOS Hotline gave me extremely helpful guidance. Yanna-Torry cleaned our list and supported us beyond the call."
– Megan S, UK

**Testimonial 2:**
"Real human expertise. Tailor-made solutions. Not an AI tool."
– Chris Mead, UK

**Testimonial 3:**
"RME provides deep insights our ESP misses and helped us segment smarter."

## Section 7: Why Free?

**Heading:**
Why Is This Free?

**Body:**
Trust beats tactics.

We offer real help without charging because it is the right thing to do. Some people need a quick answer. Some need deeper support. Either way, the conversation starts the same.

If you need more than guidance, we offer list cleaning and strategy calls. But there is no pressure. The SOS Hotline exists to help, not to sell.

---

## Section 8: Bridge to Paid Services

**Heading:**
Need More Than Advice?

**Body:**
Sometimes guidance is not enough. If you need hands-on help, we offer:

**List Cleaning**
Send us your list. We clean it and return clear recommendations.

**CTA:** Get My List Cleaned →

**Strategy Call**
Book a 30-minute call to go deeper on your specific situation.

Available standalone or bundled with list cleaning.

**CTA:** Learn More About Calls →
