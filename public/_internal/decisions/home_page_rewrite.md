Date: 2026-01-16

Status: Ready to apply in Wix

Purpose: Full rewrite following approved structure with How It Works and Why We're Different merged in

---

## Instructions

Replace body content on Home page with this copy.
Copy only. Do not redesign layout.
YT voice. Short sentences. No SaaS language. Translation friendly. Premium positioning.

---

## Section 1: Hero

**Heading:**
Email List Cleaning with Expert Guidance

**Subheading:**
We clean your list and tell you what the results actually mean.

**Body:**
Done-for-you cleaning is available now. Send us your list. We return it with clear recommendations and optional expert support.

**Primary CTA:**
Get My List Cleaned → (link to anchor.reviewmyemails.com)

**Secondary CTA:**
Join the Waitlist (for self-serve access)

---

## Section 2: Who This Is For

**Heading:**
Who This Is For

**Body:**
Marketers responsible for email results.

You have been in email for a while. You know the basics. But something feels off.

- Engagement is dropping and you do not know why
- Bounces are creeping up
- Your ESP sent a warning
- You inherited a list you did not build
- Your boss wants you to "email everyone" and you know that is risky

You are not looking for another dashboard. You want answers.

---

## Section 3: The Real Problem

**Heading:**
The Problem with Most List Cleaning

**Body:**
Most tools give you a status: Valid. Invalid. Unknown.

That tells you what to remove. It does not tell you what is actually wrong.

- Why is engagement dropping?
- Why are complaints rising?
- Is it the list, the sending behavior, or both?

The real issues are often invisible:

- Bad acquisition (contests, purchased lists, old opt-ins)
- Oversending to unengaged contacts
- Poor segmentation
- Pressure from executives to "just send"

You do not need more data. You need someone who can read the patterns and explain what they mean.

---

## Section 4: How It Works

**Heading:**
How It Works

**Subheading:**
Two ways to clean your list. Same analysis. You choose who clicks the buttons.

---

**Block 1: Done-For-You (Available Now)**

Send us your list. We handle everything.

What happens:
1. You send us your file
2. We run validation, risk scoring, and pattern analysis
3. We return your list with clear recommendations
4. Optional: Book an SOS call to review results

Turnaround: Typically 24-48 hours depending on list size.

**CTA:** Get My List Cleaned →

---

**Block 2: Self-Serve (Coming Soon)**

Upload your list in the platform. Download results. Interpret on your own or book a call.

Self-serve access is opening in stages. Join the waitlist to get notified when it is your turn.

**CTA:** Join the Waitlist →

---

**Block 3: What You Get Back**

Every contact sorted into three categories:

- **Keep** — Safe to mail
- **Monitor** — Watch engagement closely
- **Suppress** — Do not mail

Plus:
- Risk flags on problem patterns
- Domain-level intelligence
- Clear explanations for every recommendation

This is not a pass/fail list. It is a decision-making tool.

---

## Section 5: Why We Are Different

**Heading:**
What Makes This Different

**Body (short blocks, not paragraphs):**

**Human review, not just automation**
Our system flags risks. A real expert reviews the patterns and explains what they mean.

**Keep / Monitor / Suppress**
Not binary valid/invalid. Three categories that match how you actually make sending decisions.

**Clear explanations**
Every recommendation comes with context. You will know why, not just what.

**Access to real expertise**
Questions? Book an SOS call. Talk to someone who reviews lists one by one and can tell you what yours actually needs.

---

## Section 6: Social Proof

**Heading:**
What Our Clients Say

**Testimonial 1:**
"Review My Emails goes beyond standard tools by identifying risky patterns others miss."
– Julia S, Italy

**Testimonial 2:**
"Real human expertise. Tailor-made solutions. Not an AI tool."

---

## Section 7: SOS Hotline Teaser

**Heading:**
Need More Than Data?

**Body:**
In a real deliverability crisis, you do not need another tool. You need a lifeline.

The SOS Deliverability Hotline connects you with a real expert who has seen it all. Blocklists. ESP warnings. Engagement crashes. We help you understand what is actually happening and what to do about it.

Use it before cleaning to understand your situation.
Use it after cleaning to interpret results and plan next steps.

**CTA:** Learn About SOS Hotline →

---

## Section 8: Primary CTA Section

**Heading:**
Ready to Clean Your List?

**Body:**
Choose what works for you.

**CTA 1:** Get My List Cleaned → (link to anchor.reviewmyemails.com)
Done-for-you. Available now.

**CTA 2:** Join the Waitlist →
Get notified when self-serve opens.

**CTA 3:** Talk to an Expert →
Book an SOS call.

---

## Section 9: Waitlist Form (Simplified)

**Heading:**
Join the Waitlist

**Body:**
Get notified when self-serve access opens for you.

**Form fields:**
- Email (required)
- Checkbox: Get notified when self-serve opens.

**Submit button:** Join Waitlist

---

## Content to REMOVE from Current Page

Remove these elements entirely:

1. "The Waitlist is Open. Join now for a launch-day bonus, with 15,000 free credits..." — Remove bonus language
2. "Send me expert advice, plus exclusive updates and offers for waitlist members" — Simplify to just notification
3. "Get My Invite 💌" — Replace with "Join Waitlist"
4. Any Delphi speaking lines (if present on Home)
5. Denise H. testimonial (not in Proof Library) — Already addressed in Priority 1
6. Any language implying platform is fully live for self-serve
7. "The Self-Serve Review My Emails platform is almost here" — Contradicts reality
