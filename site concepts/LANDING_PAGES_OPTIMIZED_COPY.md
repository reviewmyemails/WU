# Review My Emails - Expert Conversation Series
## Optimized Landing Page Copy (January 2026)

---

# PAGE 1: ABOUT PAGE (Cold Outreach Landing)
**URL:** `/what-esps-wont-tell-you-series-about`

**Purpose:** This is the first page creators see when you DM them. It needs to answer: "What is this?" and "Why should I care?"

---

## OPTION A: Direct & Professional

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
# We're Recording Honest Conversations About Email Deliverability

**Subheadline:**
Review My Emails is building a library of real-world insights from practitioners who work hands-on with email. Not theory. Not best practices. What actually happens.

---

### What This Is

Each month, we record focused discussions around a specific deliverability theme.

These aren't promotional interviews or scripted webinars. They're practical conversations about inbox problems, list quality issues, and the trade-offs experienced operators actually deal with—but rarely talk about publicly.

We're looking for people who:
- Work directly with email, deliverability, or list management
- Have real experience (not just certifications or theory)
- Are willing to share what doesn't work, not just what does

---

### What You Get

**Your expertise, amplified across our channels all year long.**

From one conversation, we create:

- **Featured blog content** — Your best answers become the anchor of that month's article, with full transcript and attribution
- **Video clips for social** — Short-form cuts promoted across LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram throughout the year
- **Permanent attribution** — Your name, handle, and links included everywhere your insights appear
- **Cross-promotion** — Tagged, linked, and referenced every time we share your clips

This isn't a one-time feature. Your insights stay in rotation as long as they're relevant.

---

### What It Looks Like

- ~60 minute recorded conversation (video call)
- Guided discussion, not a formal interview
- No slides, scripts, or prep required
- You pick which questions interest you most
- We handle recording, editing, and distribution

---

### This Month's Theme

**January: Post-Holiday Deliverability Recovery**
*"The Deliverability Detox"*

Q4 creates reputation debt. Over-mailing, relaxed hygiene, inflated metrics, and ignored suppression rules compound quietly. January is about repairing list damage, resetting expectations, and stabilizing sender reputation before further harm is done.

### Who's Behind This

Review My Emails is a deliverability-focused list intelligence company founded by Yanna-Torry Aspraki.

We clean email lists, yes—but more importantly, we help senders understand what's actually happening with their data. This series is an extension of that mission: capturing real practitioner knowledge that doesn't exist in ESP documentation.

---

## OPTION B: Warmer & More Conversational

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
# Most Email Content Is Written by Marketers.
# We Want to Hear From the People Who Actually Fix Things.

**Subheadline:**
We're recording monthly conversations with practitioners who work hands-on in email—the people who deal with deliverability problems, list quality issues, and inbox placement realities that don't fit neatly into best practices.

---

### Why We're Doing This

There's a gap.

Most content about email deliverability comes from platforms protecting their own interests, or marketers repeating surface-level advice.

The people who actually know what's happening—the ones debugging authentication issues at midnight, cleaning lists that should never have been sent to, explaining to stakeholders why their open rates are lying—those people rarely get to share what they've learned.

This series exists to change that.

---

### What Happens When You Participate

We record a ~60 minute conversation. You pick the questions you want to discuss from that month's theme. No prep, no slides, no scripts—just a real discussion about what you've seen and what you think.

From that one conversation, we create content that works for you all year:

**Your answers become the article**
The strongest responses to each question become the core of that month's blog post. Full transcript, your name, your links.

**Your clips stay in rotation**
We cut short-form video for LinkedIn, TikTok, and Instagram. These get promoted throughout the year—not just once.

**You get tagged everywhere**
Every time we share your content, you're credited, linked, and referenced. This isn't exposure that disappears. It compounds.

---

### Who This Is For

This works best if you:

- Actually work with email lists, deliverability, or inbox placement
- Have opinions based on experience (not just what you've read)
- Can explain trade-offs and hard calls, not just "best practices"
- Are comfortable saying "this is what I've seen" without needing a citation

If you spend time in ESPs, email tools, or client inboxes—and you have thoughts about what really happens vs. what the documentation says—this is for you.

---

### This Month's Focus

**January: Post-Holiday Deliverability Recovery**

The theme: What actually breaks during Q4, and what does it take to fix it in January?

We're asking questions like:
- What long-term damage do brands carry out of November and December without realizing it?
- Which January performance metrics give a false sense of recovery?
- What's the most common January decision that quietly locks in poor inbox placement for months?

## Section: January Questions

**January Theme: Post-Holiday Deliverability Recovery**
*"The Deliverability Detox"*

Q4 creates reputation debt. Over-mailing, relaxed hygiene, inflated metrics, and ignored suppression rules compound quietly. January is about repairing list damage, resetting expectations, and stabilizing sender reputation before further harm is done.

**Select the questions you'd be most interested in discussing:**

*(Checkboxes)*

- [ ] From a deliverability perspective, what long-term damage do brands usually carry out of November and December without realizing it?

- [ ] Which January performance metrics give a false sense of recovery, and why are they misleading for deliverability?

- [ ] **Surprising:** What part of Q4 damage do brands almost never attribute to email, even though it clearly is?

- [ ] **Reality check:** If inbox placement is down and revenue is under pressure, what do you stop sending first in January?

- [ ] **Operator mistake:** What is the most common January decision that quietly locks in poor inbox placement for months?

### Page Title
**Conversation Prep: What to Expect**

---

### Intro

This document helps you feel comfortable going into the recording.

These conversations are designed to sound like real discussions between people who work in email—not presentations, interviews, or sales pitches.

---

### The Format

- Sessions are conversational and guided
- No script, no slide deck
- Questions act as anchors, not a rigid agenda
- We'll move naturally between topics based on what's most useful

Sessions run about an hour. We won't rush through everything—we'd rather go deep on a few questions than skim the surface of many.

---

### How Questions Work

You've already selected the questions you're interested in discussing.

Because of time, we'll prioritize a subset during the call. The goal is depth, not coverage. If we don't get to something, it's not a problem—we're after quality, not completeness.

---

### What to Prepare (And What Not To)

**You don't need:**
- Slides or decks
- Stats or benchmarks
- Scripts or talking points
- Marketing messages

**What actually helps:**
- Real experiences from your work
- Trade-offs you've seen firsthand
- Mistakes, constraints, or edge cases
- Strong opinions you can explain

Speaking from experience matters more than being "right."

---

### Disagreement Is Welcome

If you disagree with a question—or with common industry advice—say so.

Clear, respectful disagreement often leads to the strongest insights. You're encouraged to explain why something doesn't work in practice, or where conventional wisdom breaks down.

The best clips usually come from honest opinions, not safe answers.

---

### During the Recording

- Expect a relaxed, professional tone
- You'll be guided through the discussion
- It's fine to pause, think, or rephrase
- We can always restate or clarify a point

This is not live. We edit for clarity.

---

### After the Recording

We curate:
- Written excerpts for blog content
- Short video clips for social channels
- Transcripts for internal and editorial use

Your insights may appear in different formats throughout the year. Even if your full answer isn't in the main article, clips from your conversation may still be highlighted separately—always with credit.

---

### Final Reassurance

You don't need to perform.

Show up with honest experience and a willingness to think out loud. That's exactly what makes these conversations valuable.

---

---

# PAGE 4: RECORDING GUIDELINES

**Purpose:** Technical setup checklist. Keep it simple and actionable.

### Page Title
**Recording Guidelines**

---

### Intro

These guidelines help ensure a smooth recording and consistent quality across all conversations.

This isn't about perfection—it's about clarity and minimal distractions. A clean setup helps the focus stay on the ideas.

---

### The Basics

- Sessions are conversational and unscripted
- You don't need slides, notes, or prepared answers
- We handle recording, editing, and distribution

---

### Audio

Good audio matters more than good video.

**Recommended:**
- External microphone or quality headset
- Wired headphones (more reliable than Bluetooth)
- Quiet space with minimal echo

**Avoid if possible:**
- Laptop built-in microphone
- Echo-heavy rooms
- Background noise (fans, traffic, open windows)

*If you have to choose between better audio or better video, choose audio.*

---

### Video & Framing

- Camera at eye level (not looking down)
- Stable setup (no handheld devices)
- Landscape orientation
- Head and shoulders in frame
- Look slightly toward the camera, not down at it

---

### Lighting

- Face a natural or soft light source
- Light should come from in front of you, not behind
- Avoid strong overhead lighting or backlighting

A window works well. You don't need studio lights.

---

### Background

- Neutral, uncluttered background
- Avoid visual distractions behind you
- Quiet, private space where you won't be interrupted

Virtual backgrounds are fine if your setup supports them cleanly, but a real background is usually better.

---

### What to Wear

- Professional and comfortable
- Solid colors work best on camera
- Avoid tight patterns or shiny/reflective fabrics

This is a professional discussion, not a broadcast—dress how you'd dress for a video call with a client.

---

### Internet

- Stable connection required
- Wired connection preferred if available
- Close unnecessary apps before recording

---

### What We Handle

- Recording
- Editing
- Clip selection
- Transcripts and captions
- Publishing and distribution

---

### What You're Responsible For

- Arriving on time
- Audio and video setup
- Recording environment

---

### Questions?

If something is unclear or difficult to meet, let us know ahead of time. We're happy to help.

# BONUS: SERIES NAMING OPTIONS

The current name "What ESPs Won't Tell You" is strong positioning but awkward as a title. Here are alternatives:

---

## Option 1: Keep It, But Frame It Better

**Series name:** What ESPs Won't Tell You
**Tagline:** Real conversations about email deliverability

Use the name as a positioning statement, not the headline. The headline becomes "Real conversations about email deliverability" and "What ESPs Won't Tell You" becomes the series identity.

---

## Option 2: Simpler, More Direct

**Series name:** The Deliverability Conversations
**Tagline:** Honest discussions with people who actually work in email

Less provocative, but cleaner. Works well if you want a more neutral, professional tone.

---

## Option 3: Keep the Edge

**Series name:** Off the Record
**Tagline:** What practitioners know about email that platforms don't tell you

Plays on the idea of insider knowledge. "Off the record" implies candor.

---

## Option 4: Practitioner-Focused

**Series name:** From the Inbox
**Tagline:** Conversations with people who fix deliverability problems for a living

Emphasizes the practitioner angle—these are people in the trenches, not thought leaders.

---

## Option 5: No Series Name

Just call it: **Review My Emails Conversations**

Sometimes simpler is better. The monthly themes do the heavy lifting (The Deliverability Detox, Harbor Entry Requirements, etc.) and you don't need a separate series brand.

---

## My Recommendation

**Go with Option 1 or Option 5.**

Option 1 keeps the provocative edge ("What ESPs Won't Tell You") but uses it as positioning rather than forcing it into headlines.

Option 5 is the simplest—you already have strong monthly themes. The series doesn't need its own brand.

Either way: the monthly sea-themed titles (The Deliverability Detox, Crew Loyalty Under Pressure, etc.) are doing good work. Let those be the memorable elements.

---

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. **About page** is the biggest change—this is where conversion happens or doesn't
2. **Form page** intro copy is important but short—focus on reducing friction
3. **What to Expect** and **Recording Guidelines** are already decent—minor polish only
4. **Remove "CONFIDENTIAL PARTNER DOCUMENT"** from the prep docs—it sounds corporate and unnecessary
