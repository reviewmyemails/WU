JANUARY

English theme
Post-Holiday Deliverability Recovery

2026 sea theme
The Deliverability Detox

What this month is about
Q4 creates reputation debt. Over-mailing, relaxed hygiene, inflated metrics, and ignored suppression rules compound quietly. January is about repairing list damage, resetting expectations, and stabilizing sender reputation before further harm is done.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. From a deliverability perspective, what long-term damage do brands usually carry out of November and December without realizing it?
2. Which January performance metrics give a false sense of recovery, and why are they misleading for deliverability?
3. What part of Q4 damage do brands almost never attribute to email, even though it clearly is?
4. If inbox placement is down and revenue is under pressure, what do you stop sending first in January?
5. What is the most common January decision that quietly locks in poor inbox placement for months?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FEBRUARY

English theme
Engagement Reality and Subscriber Trust

2026 sea theme
Crew Loyalty Under Pressure

What this month is about
February moves from panic to clarity. The focus is separating real engagement from vanity metrics, reinforcing consent and expectations, and recognizing when subscribers no longer want your emails. Keeping disengaged contacts is framed as a long-term cost, not a neutral decision.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. From a deliverability and inbox placement perspective, what does real engagement actually mean today?
2. Why do email teams confuse opens and clicks with subscriber trust?
3. What is the hidden deliverability cost of keeping subscribers who have not engaged in over six months?
4. What behavior do subscribers tolerate without complaint, but mailbox providers still punish?
5. If you had to choose between list size and inbox placement in February, which do you sacrifice and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



MARCH

English theme
Authentication Without the Myths

2026 sea theme
Harbor Entry Requirements

What this month is about
March addresses the technical foundations that determine whether email even has a chance to be seen. It cuts through SPF, DKIM, and DMARC misconceptions and explains why passing authentication checks does not guarantee inbox placement.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Which authentication myths cause the most damage to deliverability decision-making?
2. What authentication issues tend to break silently, without obvious errors or alerts?
3. What common authentication “best practice” do teams implement correctly on paper, but still end up hurting deliverability in the real world?
4. What part of authentication do teams obsess over that rarely fixes real inboxing problems?
5. If you could only fix one authentication-related issue before scaling, what would it be and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

APRIL

English theme
Metrics That Lie

2026 sea theme
Faulty Instruments

What this month is about
April challenges blind trust in dashboards. Bots, privacy protections, and ESP reporting distort reality and lead to bad decisions. This month teaches how to identify misleading metrics and interpret data in a way that actually protects deliverability.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Which email performance metric is currently the most misleading for deliverability decisions?
2. How do bots and privacy protections distort engagement data in ways teams underestimate?
3. Why can unusually high open rates be a deliverability warning sign rather than a success signal?
4. What "good-looking" metric most often masks a serious deliverability problem?
5. If leadership forces you to report one metric in April, which one actually protects inbox placement and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MAY

English theme
Silent Deliverability Killers

2026 sea theme
Hull Breaches Below the Waterline

What this month is about
May focuses on problems that quietly destroy performance over time. Dead domains, role accounts, accept-all addresses, and slow list decay create invisible leaks that reduce ROI without obvious failures. Detection and ongoing monitoring are the priority.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. What does a silent deliverability failure look like before inbox placement visibly collapses?
2. Why do dead domains and role accounts cause long-term reputation damage instead of obvious bounces?
3. Why are accept-all domains more dangerous for deliverability than they appear?
4. What tiny percentage of bad data causes disproportionate deliverability harm?
5. If you could only remove one risky segment today to protect the rest of the list, what would it be and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

JUNE

English theme
B2B Deliverability Is Different

2026 sea theme
Commercial Shipping Lanes

What this month is about
June covers the realities of B2B inboxing. Corporate filters, Microsoft dominance, security gateways, and IT policies make B2B deliverability fundamentally different from B2C. The focus is stricter hygiene, suppression logic, and enterprise expectations.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Why is B2B deliverability fundamentally harder than B2C, even at lower sending volumes?
2. How do Microsoft and corporate security gateways change inbox placement rules for B2B senders?
3. Why do IT and security policies often suppress legitimate marketing email?
4. What B2B sending practice feels conservative but actually increases deliverability risk?
5. In B2B, when does suppression protect deliverability more than reach?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

JULY

English theme
Seasonal Engagement Decline

2026 sea theme
Calm Seas and Hidden Drift

What this month is about
July addresses predictable summer behavior changes. Engagement drops, inbox patterns shift, and unattended automations can quietly damage reputation. This month is about reducing volume, adjusting expectations, and preparing lists for Q4.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Why does subscriber engagement predictably drop in summer from a behavioral and deliverability standpoint?
2. When should teams reduce sending volume instead of increasing frequency during low-engagement periods?
3. How do unattended automations quietly damage deliverability when engagement dips?
4. What summer "best practice" usually backfires and harms inbox placement?
5. If engagement drops sharply in July, what do you reduce first—volume, frequency, or audience, and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

AUGUST

English theme
ESP Myths and Misconceptions

2026 sea theme
False Lighthouse Signals

What this month is about
August positions Review My Emails as a platform-agnostic authority. ESP advice often protects the platform rather than the sender. This month examines where generic guidance fails and why list quality matters more than tooling.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. What parts of ESP deliverability advice are most misleading for real-world inbox placement?
2. Where does generic ESP guidance break down for senders with complex lists or mixed audiences?
3. Why does switching ESPs rarely fix underlying deliverability problems?
4. What ESP feature or recommendation distracts teams the most from fixing real list issues?
5. If your ESP says everything is fine but inboxing tells a different story, which signal do you trust and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SEPTEMBER

English theme
Warming Up Sending Infrastructure Safely

2026 sea theme
Slow Launch, Safe Voyage

What this month is about
September begins Q4 preparation. The focus is warming infrastructure correctly, balancing volume with consistency, and fixing cold or neglected sending setups so reputation is engineered before peak periods.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Why do most warmup plans fail before meaningful volume is reached?
2. How fast is objectively too fast when increasing send volume?
3. Why does consistency matter more than raw volume during warmup?
4. What warmup habit feels safe but quietly damages long-term deliverability?
5. If warmup metrics look fine but inbox placement is weak, what do you change first and why?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OCTOBER

English theme
Q4 Deliverability Risk Prevention

2026 sea theme
Battening Down the Hatches

What this month is about
October is the final opportunity for deep cleanup and risk reduction. The emphasis is on identifying weak points, testing safely, and avoiding last-minute changes that could collapse deliverability during peak sending.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. What typically breaks first when sending volume ramps up for Q4?
2. How can brands protect sender reputation when revenue pressure peaks?
3. Why does gradual volume creep often cause more deliverability damage than sudden spikes?
4. What Q4 tactic feels necessary but is rarely worth the deliverability risk?
5. If revenue targets conflict with inbox safety in October, what do you protect at all costs?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

NOVEMBER

English theme
Scaling Without Killing Deliverability

2026 sea theme
High Seas Navigation

What this month is about
November deals with the pressure to scale. Volume amplifies mistakes and discipline becomes critical. This month focuses on resisting shortcuts and protecting long-term sender reputation during peak commercial periods.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. Why does aggressive list scaling often destroy deliverability instead of driving sustainable growth?
2. What is the deliverability difference between buying growth and earning it?
3. When does automation behavior cross the line from efficiency into spam-like patterns?
4. What growth metric pressures teams into making the worst deliverability decisions?
5. If leadership demands faster growth in November, what deliverability safeguard do you refuse to remove?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DECEMBER

English theme
Year-End Deliverability Review

2026 sea theme
Safe Harbor Lists

What this month is about
December is about reflection and protection. It highlights long-term list trust, VIP subscribers, and mistakes that should not be repeated, while preparing the list for a clean reset going into the next year.

**Selected 2026 core questions**

1. What were the most damaging deliverability mistakes brands made this year, even if results looked fine?
2. What inbox or filtering behavior changed this year that most senders failed to notice?
3. What deliverability belief should brands actively unlearn before next year?
4. What mistake keeps repeating every year despite better tools and education?
5. If you could only change one list or sending habit before next year, what would it be and why?

How the form works
Each month focuses on a single theme and includes a short set of core questions (5).


You’re welcome to select any questions that genuinely interest you or match your experience. You don’t need to limit yourself to just one.


During the call, we’ll prioritize a subset of the questions you selected, focusing on the ones that best fit the flow of the discussion and any gaps we want to explore.


Please avoid selecting questions you don’t feel strongly about. This works best when you choose topics you genuinely have insight on.
