         PAGE STRUCTURE OUTLINE
         ======================================== -->

    <!-- HEADER: Same as homepage -->

    <!-- HERO
         - Headline: "Is your list the problem?"
         - Subhead: Brief framing about self-diagnosis
         - No CTA here — checklist IS the action
    -->

    <!-- CHECKLIST INTRO
         - Framing: "Check every symptom that applies to you"
         - Sets expectation: some are list problems, some aren't
    -->

    <!-- CHECKLIST SECTION 1: Recognition Symptoms
         Full list of all 12 Tier 1 symptoms from symptom-strategy-final.md

         Categories (for organization, not visual buckets):
         - Emotional/Fear-Based
         - Trust/Confusion (Burned by Tools)
         - Internal Politics
         - Migration/Transition
    -->

    <!-- CHECKLIST SECTION 2: Crisis Symptoms
         - Blocklisted
         - ESP compliance warning
         - Bounce spike
         - Framing: "If you checked any of these, start here"
    -->

    <!-- CHECKLIST SECTION 3: Adjacent Symptoms (Optional)
         - Tier 2 symptoms with honest framing
         - "This could be your list — or it could be something else"
    -->

    <!-- RESULTS / NEXT STEPS
         Dynamic based on what they checked:
         - 0 checked: "Your list might be fine. Here's how to keep it that way."
         - 1-3 checked: "Worth investigating. Here's what these symptoms usually mean."
         - 4+ checked: "Multiple signals. Time for expert eyes."
         - Crisis checked: Routes to SOS immediately
         - All other paths: Routes to standard review with interpretation included

         ROUTING LOGIC:
         - Crisis = SOS Hotline (expedited, higher touch)
         - Everything else = Standard review order
    -->

    <!-- INTERPRETATION FRAMING
         Position: "Expert interpretation included with every order"

         Access levels (honest, tier-appropriate):
         - Small orders: Written interpretation + option to request a short walkthrough
         - Large orders: Scheduled walkthrough included by default

         NOTE: Never say "free." Say "included."
         This keeps the promise consistent without implying unlimited consulting for $8.

    <!-- CTA SECTION
         - Primary: "Get answers about your list"
         - Secondary: "Take the 2-minute risk check" (quiz)
         - Tertiary: "Questions? Talk to us"
