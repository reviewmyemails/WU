# RME Symptom Strategy - Final
## Which Symptoms Point Directly to List Validation

*Date: January 2026*
*Status: LOCKED for homepage implementation*

---

## The Filter

For a symptom to appear on the website, it must pass this test:

> "If someone has this problem, is list validation THE answer—not one possible answer among many?"

---

## TIER 1: DIRECT — Use These on Homepage

These symptoms directly point to list validation as the solution.

### Emotional/Fear-Based (Scroll-Stoppers)

| # | Symptom | Why It's Direct |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **"Scared to remove any emails from your list"** | They need data + permission to clean. Validation provides both. |
| 2 | **"Paying for subscribers who haven't opened in months"** | Quantifiable waste. Validation shows exactly who to cut. |
| 3 | **"List growing but engaged subscribers staying flat"** | Quality vs quantity problem. Validation reveals the gap. |

### Trust/Confusion (Burned by Tools)

| # | Symptom | Why It's Direct |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 4 | **"Validator marked huge sections 'Unknown'—now what?"** | RME's differentiation. Expert interpretation of ambiguous results. |
| 5 | **"One tool says clean, another says dirty"** | Conflicting data needs resolution. Expert call resolves it. |

### Internal Politics

| # | Symptom | Why It's Direct |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 6 | **"Boss pressuring to send to whole list"** | Need third-party authority. Validation report = ammunition. |
| 7 | **"No idea where half our subscribers came from"** | Unknown provenance = unknown risk. Validation reveals what's actually there. |

### Crisis/Urgency (High Intent)

| # | Symptom | Why It's Direct |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 8 | **"Listed on blocklist—need help getting off"** | Must clean list + may need help with blocklist communication. |
| 9 | **"ESP gave compliance warning or suspended account"** | Need proof of clean list to get reinstated. Validation = evidence. |

### Migration/Transition

| # | Symptom | Why It's Direct |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 10 | **"Switching ESPs—need to know what's safe to bring"** | Natural cleaning moment. Don't bring garbage to new home. |
| 11 | **"Haven't sent in 6+ months—want to restart safely"** | Re-engagement requires validation first. High bounce risk otherwise. |
| 12 | **"Acquired another company's list"** | Unknown quality list. Must validate before merging/sending. |

---

## TIER 2: ADJACENT — Use With Careful Framing

These MIGHT be list quality, but could also be other things. Use sparingly, with honest framing.

| Symptom | When It's List Quality | When It's NOT |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| Same campaigns performing worse every quarter | List decay (addresses aging out) | Content fatigue, competition |
| Sending to more people but conversion dropping | Dilution with bad addresses | Offer quality, landing pages |
| High bounces after a send | Dirty list | One-time domain issue |

**Framing for adjacent symptoms:** "This could be your list—or it could be something else. Here's how to find out."

---

## CUT — Do Not Use on Homepage

### Wrong Service (Not List Validation)

| Symptom | Why Cut | What They Actually Need |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| Gmail inboxing worse, others fine | Provider-specific reputation issue | Deliverability consulting |
| Emails arrive but nobody sees them | Inbox placement problem | Sender reputation work |
| Engagement feels random | Content/segmentation strategy | Email marketing strategy |
| New subscribers engage once, disappear | Onboarding/welcome series problem | Content strategy |
| 40% opens, 0% clicks (bot opens) | Analytics/measurement problem | Different tracking approach |

### Wrong Moment (Not Shopping for Validation)

| Symptom | Why Cut |
|---------|---------|
| Validated but bounces still happen | Complaint mode, not buying mode. Use in FAQ. |
| Major product launch, opens tanked day 1 | Crisis mode. They'll come back later. |

### Off-Brand

| Symptom | Why Cut |
|---------|---------|
| Cold outreach bounce rate over 5% | Different market. RME isn't for cold email. |
| Boss pressuring to blast whole list | External blame framing. Keep the "need authority" version instead. |
| Tool support sent automated article | Competitor attack. Not self-diagnosis. |

## Homepage Implementation Notes

### Order of Symptoms (Emotional Journey)

**⚠️ SUPERSEDED BY V3:** The v3 homepage implementation (January 2026) locks a different ordering:
- **V3 uses confusion-first**, not emotional-first
- See `v3-homepage-locked-decisions.md` for the locked symptom order
- The rationale: "Start with confusion, not failure" hooks the "I'm competent but lost" visitor without accusatory tone

**Original recommendation (for reference):**
1. Start with **emotional** (scared, paying for waste) — hooks overconfident marketers
2. Move to **confusion** (tools disagree, unknown results) — hooks burned-by-tools
3. End with **crisis** (blocklist, ESP warning) — captures high-intent urgent buyers

### Language Rules

- Use "you" not "your company"
- Use plain language, no jargon
- Frame as recognition, not accusation
- No fear marketing — clarity, not panic

### CTA After Symptoms

**For homepage:** "Sound familiar? Get answers about your list."

**Not:** "Worried? Buy now." (fear marketing)

---

## Symptoms NOT on Homepage, But Useful Elsewhere

### FAQ/Objection Handling
- "Validated but bounces still happen" — explains validation limitations
- "What if I've tried other tools?" — differentiation

### Blog/Content
- Provider-specific deliverability issues
- Engagement strategy symptoms
- Content/frequency problems

### SOS Page
- Crisis symptoms get more detail here
- Blocklist help process
- ESP reinstatement support

## Final Checklist Before Using a Symptom

- [ ] Does this symptom point to LIST QUALITY specifically?
- [ ] Would someone with this symptom Google "email list validation"?
- [ ] Can RME actually fix this with validation + expert call?
- [ ] Is this recognition, not accusation?
- [ ] Does this avoid fear marketing?
- [ ] Is this jargon-free?

If any answer is NO, don't use it on the homepage.

## Summary

**12 DIRECT symptoms** for homepage use
**3 ADJACENT symptoms** for careful use with framing
**Everything else** goes to FAQ, blog, or gets cut

The homepage symptom section should create recognition ("that's me") that leads directly to "I need to validate my list" — not "I need deliverability help" or "I need email strategy."
