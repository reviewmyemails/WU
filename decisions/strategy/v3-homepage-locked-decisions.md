# V3 Homepage Locked Decisions
## Implementation Rules for RME Editorial Homepage

*Date: January 2026*
*Status: LOCKED*

---

## Core Positioning (Locked)

- **"Answers, not validation"** — never use "validate" or "validation"
- **Expert interpretation INCLUDED with every order** — not "free," not "bonus"
- **Sell clarity + judgment** — not software, not dashboards
- **Product + expert = one thing** — not separate offerings

---

## Symptom Section Decisions

### Symptom Ordering: Confusion-First

**Locked order:**
1. No idea where half this list came from. *(confusion)*
2. One tool says clean. Another says risky. *(burned by tools)*
3. Scared to remove subscribers — even the ones who never open. *(fear)*
4. Haven't emailed this list in months. Afraid to restart. *(dormancy)*
5. Paid for list cleaning yesterday. Bounces today. *(tool failure)*
6. Open rates dropped and nobody can explain why. *(mystery)*
7. List keeps growing. Revenue doesn't. *(disconnect)*

**Rationale:**
- Start with confusion, not failure
- Hooks the "I'm competent but lost" visitor
- Failure symptoms come after trust is built
- Avoids accusatory tone at first contact

### Crisis Section

**Framing:** "If any of these are true, start here."

**Crisis symptoms:**
- ESP sent a compliance warning or paused your sending.
- Blocklisted — or you think you might be.
- Last send spiked bounces. Now everyone's afraid to send again.

**Rules:**
- Crisis is triage, not emergency alarm
- Crisis gets its own CTA inside the block
- Route crisis clicks to SOS, not standard checkout

### Clarification Line

**Locked copy:**
> "Validation tools check if addresses exist. We tell you why your emails aren't working — list quality, deliverability, or both — and what to do next."

**Why this works:**
- Differentiation built in (tools vs. us)
- Honest scope (could be list, could be deliverability, could be both)
- Action-oriented ending

---

## Framing Constraints (Locked)

### "Included" — Never "Free"

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|-------|
| "Free expert interpretation" | "Expert interpretation included" |
| "Bonus: talk to an expert" | "Every order includes interpretation" |
| "Free walkthrough available" | "Walkthrough included with larger orders" |

**Rationale:**
- "Free" implies separate thing that could be removed
- "Included" means it's part of the product
- Prevents expectation of unlimited consulting for $8

### Interpretation Access Levels (Honest, Tier-Appropriate)

| Order Size | What's Included |
|------------|-----------------|
| Small orders | Written interpretation + option to request short walkthrough |
| Large orders | Scheduled walkthrough included by default |

**Rule:** Be honest about what's practical. Don't promise 1:1 calls for every $8 order.

---

## Structural Elements

### Bridge Line (Hero → Symptoms)

**Location:** End of hero section, before symptoms

**Purpose:** Connect hero promise to symptom recognition

**Locked copy:**
> "Most email problems trace back to list quality."

**Rules:**
- One sentence only
- No CTA
- Transitions reader into symptoms section

### Crisis CTA Placement

**Location:** Inside the crisis block, not after clarification line

**Copy:** "Start here →"

**Destination:** SOS priority path (distinct from main CTA)

**Visual:** Secondary button style, not competing with main CTA

---

## CTA Architecture

### Three CTAs (Locked)

| CTA | Copy | Location | Destination |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| Main | "Get answers about your list" | After clarification, footer | anchor.reviewmyemails.com/buy-credits |
| Quiz | "Take the 2-minute risk check" | After clarification | Quiz page |
| Crisis | "Start here →" | Inside crisis block | SOS path |

### CTA Rules

- Main CTA is primary visual weight
- Quiz CTA is secondary (for uncertain visitors)
- Crisis CTA lives inside crisis block only
- Never use "Start free trial" or "Sign up now"

---

## Copy Constraints (Locked)

### Words We Use
- answers
- clarity
- certainty
- interpretation
- patterns
- risk
- diagnosis
- recommendations

### Words We Avoid
- validate / validation *(see note below)*
- clean (as verb for what we do)
- revolutionary / game-changing
- innovative
- seamless / frictionless
- free (for included services)
- platform (unless literally describing software)

**Note on "validation":** This rule applies to **public-facing copy only**. Internal strategy docs may use "validation" freely. On the website, using "validation" to describe what *competitors/tools* do is acceptable (e.g., "Validation tools check if addresses exist"). The rule is: never describe RME as a "validation" service.

### Tone Rules
- Short sentences
- No idioms (multilingual requirement)
- No culture-specific references
- Simple vocabulary
- Blunt but not harsh
- Confident but not arrogant

---

## Visual Decisions (Locked)

### Typography
- **Primary:** Inter
- **Headlines:** Inter 600-700
- **Body:** Inter 400

### Colors
- **Primary:** Deep navy / dark
- **Accent:** Coral/salmon for emphasis
- **Light:** Off-white backgrounds
- **Muted:** Gray for secondary text

### Layout
- Editorial feel, not SaaS dashboard
- Generous whitespace
- Single-column symptoms for scannability
- Crisis section visually distinct (border/background)

---

## What This Document Locks

These decisions are **not open for debate** without explicit founder approval:

1. Symptom ordering (confusion-first)
2. Crisis framing approach
3. "Included" vs. "free" language
4. CTA copy and destinations
5. Clarification line wording
6. Bridge line concept
7. Crisis CTA placement

### What Can Still Be Adjusted

- Specific word choices within constraints
- Visual styling details
- Spacing and layout refinements
- Additional sections (proof, testimonials, etc.)

---

## Review Triggers

Re-evaluate these decisions if:
- Conversion data shows clear pattern after 6+ weeks
- Customer feedback reveals systematic confusion
- Business model changes (pricing, service structure)
- Major competitive shift requires repositioning
