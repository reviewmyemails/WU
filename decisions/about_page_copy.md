## Page Title

About

## Section 1: Photo

**Element:**
Photo of Yanna-Torry Aspraki (YT)

**Placement:**
Top of page, centered or left-aligned

---

## Section 2: Bio

**Body (2-3 sentences):**
I am Yanna-Torry Aspraki, founder of Review My Emails.

I help marketers understand why their emails are not reaching the inbox and what to do about it. List cleaning is the foundation. Expert guidance is what makes the difference.

---

## Section 3: What I Do

**Body:**
I specialize in email deliverability. That means:

- List validation and risk analysis
- Reputation troubleshooting
- Authentication setup (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- ESP migrations and warmups
- Explaining what your data actually means

I do not write campaigns. I do not manage your ESP. I help you understand the problem and make better decisions.

## Section 4: Credentials

**Heading:**
Recognition

**Body:**
- Best Business Award (2022)
- Top 100 Marketing & Advertising Leaders (2021)
- Litmus Coach Award (2020)

I have worked with marketers, agencies, and SaaS teams across multiple industries. I have helped recover reputations, remove blocklists, and prevent costly mistakes.

## Section 5: Personal Detail (Optional)

**Body:**
Outside of email, I hold a 5th Dan Black Belt in Karate. 25 years of discipline taught me that consistency beats shortcuts. That applies to martial arts. It applies to deliverability too.

## Section 6: Soft CTA

**Heading:**
Ready to Clean Your List?

**Body:**
Done-for-you cleaning is available now. Or talk to me first through the SOS Hotline.

**CTA 1:** Get My List Cleaned → (link to anchor.reviewmyemails.com)
