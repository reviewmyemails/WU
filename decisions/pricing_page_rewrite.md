# Pricing Page Rewrite

Date: 2026-01-16

Status: Ready to apply in Wix

Purpose: Full rewrite following Pricing Page Structure Rule (context before cost)

---

## Instructions

Replace all body content on Pricing page with this copy.
Structure follows the locked rule: what they get → who it's for → problem → how it works → THEN pricing.
YT voice. No SaaS hype. Translation friendly. No guarantees. Premium positioning.

## Page Title

## Section 1: What You Get

**Heading:**
What You Get

**Body:**
A cleaned list with clear recommendations.

Every contact sorted into three categories:

- **Keep** — Safe to mail
- **Monitor** — Watch engagement closely
- **Suppress** — Do not mail

You also get:

- Risk flags on problem patterns
- Domain-level intelligence
- Explanations for every recommendation

This is not a pass/fail list. It is a decision-making tool.

---

## Section 2: Who This Is For

**Heading:**
Who This Is For

**Body:**
Marketers who already send email and want to protect their sender reputation.

You might be:

- Running campaigns but seeing declining engagement
- Worried about bounces, complaints, or blocklists
- Inheriting a list you did not build
- Under pressure to "just send" but sensing risk
- Trying to explain deliverability to a boss who does not get it

If you care about long-term reputation, not just short-term volume, this is for you.

---

## Section 3: The Problem We Solve

**Heading:**
The Problem

**Body:**
Most list cleaning tools give you a status and leave you guessing.

Valid. Invalid. Unknown.

That tells you what to remove. It does not tell you what is actually wrong.

- Why is engagement dropping?
- Why are complaints rising?
- Is it the list, the sending, or both?

We give you the context to answer those questions.

---

## Section 4: How It Works

**Heading:**
How It Works

**Body:**
**Option 1: Done-For-You**

Send us your list. We clean it. We return results with clear recommendations.

Available now. No platform access required.

Optional SOS call before or after to review results and discuss strategy.

**Option 2: Self-Serve**

Upload your list in the platform. Download results. Interpret on your own or book a call.

Self-serve access is opening in stages. Join the waitlist to get notified.

Both options use the same analysis. The difference is who clicks the buttons.

## Section 5: Pricing

**Heading:**
Pricing

**Subheading:**
Self-Serve Credits

**Body:**
Pay only for what you need. Credits never expire.

## Content to REMOVE from Current Page

Remove these elements entirely:

1. "REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR EMAIL CAMPAIGNS" — too SaaS hype
2. "Step up your email marketing game with our innovative list optimization services" — hype language
3. "DELPHI'S GOT YOUR LIST COVERED" section — Delphi does not speak for brand
4. "Your list deserves expert care. Delphi reviews every contact..." — remove all Delphi speaking lines
5. "Features That Drive Results" — vague feature marketing
6. "Risk-Free Start: Get started with 2,500 complimentary credits" — check if still accurate, remove if not
7. "READY TO ELEVATE YOUR EMAIL STRATEGY?" — hype language
