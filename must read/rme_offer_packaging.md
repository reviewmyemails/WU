# Review My Emails – Offer & Packaging

This document defines what we sell and what we never sell.

It exists to prevent scope creep, bad-fit clients, and unclear expectations.

---

## Core Principle

List validation is the base.
Strategy is the product.
Human judgment is the differentiator.

Every offer either:

• Improves sender reputation
• Creates clarity
• Prevents future damage

If it does not do one of these, we do not sell it.
