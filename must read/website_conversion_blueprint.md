# Website Conversion Blueprint

This document defines how the Review My Emails website should work.

It exists to:

• Stop endless redesigns
• Keep focus on conversion
• Prevent "feature page sprawl"
• Make decisions easier

---

## Core Goal

The website has one main job:

**Build trust → create certainty → get them to take action**

Action means:

• Book a call
• Clean a list
• Contact you

Not:

• Read a blog
• Browse features
• Get educated for hours

---

## Site Structure

Maximum 3 core pages:

1. Home (conversion page)
2. Proof (trust page)
3. About (credibility page)

Optional utility page:

4. SOS Email Hotline

This is not a marketing page.
It is a simple explainer + entry point.

No blog.
No SEO factory.
No 20 subpages.

---

## Page 1: Home

### Goal

Turn a confused or worried visitor into:

• Someone who trusts you
• Someone who understands your difference
• Someone who takes action

### Questions this page must answer

• Why should I trust you?
• How are you different from other tools?
• Is this for me?
• What happens if I work with you?

2. Social proof

• Testimonials
• Crisis stories
• Logos (if any)

3. The problem

• Why tools fail

5. How it works

• Explain what affects cost (volume, support level)
• Reassure no hidden fees

8. Final CTA

---

## Pricing Placement Rules

Pricing lives in two places:

1. Light version on Home
   • After "How it works"
   • Before Final CTA
   • High level only
   • No complex tables

2. Full pricing on /pricing
   • This is the source of truth
   • Detailed tiers
   • Credit explanation
   • FAQ

Goal of pricing on Home:

• Qualify buyers
• Remove price shock
• Build transparency

Not to:

• Over explain
• Confuse

---

## Optional Page: SOS Email Hotline

### Goal

Explain what SOS is and who it is for.

Make it feel safe and approachable.

### This page should:

• Explain you can ask ANY email question
• Show examples of questions
• Clarify it is included with list cleaning
• Offer standalone booking
• Set boundaries (guidance, not execution)

### This page should NOT:

• Be salesy
• Be long
• Replace the playbook

Think of it as:

A front door.

---

## Page 2: Proof

### Goal

Remove doubt.

Make them think:

"These people know what they are doing."

### Content

• Testimonials
• Before/after metrics
• Case stories
• Screenshots
• Quotes
• Crisis recoveries

No fluff.

---

## Page 3: About

### Goal

Human trust.

### Content

• Your story
• Why RME exists
• Your experience
• Values

Characters:

• Can appear lightly
• As supporting cast
• Not authority

---

## CTA Rules

Always:

• Clear
• One primary action
• No 3 competing buttons

Examples:

• Clean your list
• Book SOS call
• Contact

---

## Design Rules

• Mobile first
• Simple
• No clutter

• No meaningless charts

---

## Copy Rules

• Speak like a human
• No buzzwords
• No hype
• No fake urgency
• No "AI powered" nonsense

---

## Hidden / Utility Pages (Not in Navigation)

These pages:

• Are accessed via links inside copy
• Exist to answer specific questions

Examples:

• Technical deliverability explainers
• Migration guides
• ESP specific notes
• Long form proof pages
• Career resources

Rules:

• Only create when needed

They should feel like:

Helpful side rooms
Not main hallways

• Comparison tables
n---

## Decision Rule

Before adding anything:

Ask:

"Does this increase trust or conversion?"

If no:

Do not add it.

---

## Governance: When to Break This Blueprint

Yes, your AI agents are allowed to challenge this structure.

Process:

1. Run Product Strategist agent
   • Ask if page structure still matches business reality

2. Run Conversion Architect agent
   • Ask if flow hurts conversions

3. Run Founder Filter
   • Ask if this is a distraction or a lever

Only change structure if:

• At least two agents agree
• You personally agree
• Decision is logged

This prevents random pivots.

---

## Lock Rule

Once live:

• Do not tweak weekly
• Only change with data
• Log decisions
