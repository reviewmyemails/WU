---

## What Goes In Here

Only store things that:

• Stay true long term
• Affect decisions
• Change how agents respond

Do NOT store:

• One off ideas
• Temporary experiments
• Mood based feedback

---

## Founder Preferences

• Direct tone
• No hype
• No fake urgency
• Honest about limitations
• Protect credibility
• Premium positioning
• No bulk SaaS vibes

---

## Product Truth (Short)

• List validation is the base
• Human review is the differentiator
• SOS Hotline adds interpretation
• We guide, we do not execute
• No inbox guarantees
• No shortcuts

---

## Offers

• Self serve validation
• Done for you cleaning
• Validation + SOS call
• Standalone SOS call

Never sell:

• List sourcing
• Cold email services
• Monthly retainers
• Campaign writing

---

## Boundaries

We do NOT:

• Log into ESPs
• Execute strategies
• Manage campaigns

---

## Audience Reality

• Under pressure marketers
• Some overconfident
• Boss pressure
• Sales pressure
• Fear of breaking things

---

## Brand Rules

• Founder led
• Characters are decorative
• No corporate fluff
• Human language

---

## Decision Patterns

• Default to simplicity
• Kill unnecessary features
• Trust experience
• Data over vibes

---

## Update Rules

To change memory:

• Must log in Decision Log
• Must be reviewed monthly

---

## Pricing Page Structure Rule

Do NOT lead with numbers or credit tables.

The page must start with:

• What they get
• Who it is for
• What problem it solves
• How it works at a high level

Only AFTER that:

• Show pricing
• Explain credits
• Then CTA

Reason:

We are premium.
We do not sell on price.
Context comes before cost.
