# Review My Emails – Product Truth

## What Review My Emails Is

Review My Emails (RME) is a hybrid email list cleaning and deliverability guidance service.

We operate in two modes:

**1. Done-for-you service**

Clients send us their list. We run the cleaning, enrichment, and risk analysis. We return a structured file with recommendations. Clients can optionally book a call before or after.

**2. Self-serve app + optional expert call**

Clients upload and clean their list inside the app. They receive structured results. They can optionally book a call to review results and diagnose their email program.

The difference is **who clicks the buttons**, not the quality of analysis.

In both modes, our premium differentiator is the **SOS Email Hotline**.

## What We Actually Sell

We DO sell list validation. It is the foundation of what we do, but it is not the whole offer.

We sell:

• Pattern recognition
• Root-cause diagnosis
• Strategic clarity
• Confidence in decisions

Clients come to us because something feels off or they want to prevent things from breaking.

Common triggers:

• Low inboxing
• High bounces
• Spam complaints
• Blocklists
• Weird engagement
• ESP warnings

We help them understand:

• Why their list looks the way it does
• How their acquisition methods affect quality
• How sending behavior impacts reputation
• What is actually causing the problem
• How to push back on bad internal advice (send to whole list, buy lists, don’t segment, reupload bounces)
• How to explain risks to bosses and stakeholders in real terms

This is what happens inside the SOS Email Hotline.

## Who RME Is For

Primary audience:

Marketers who *think* they are experienced because they’ve been in email a long time, but are missing modern deliverability context.

They typically:

• Already use ESPs
• Already tried other tools
• Are responsible for results
• Feel stuck
• Need answers, not dashboards

They are not beginners. They are not cold emailers. They care about reputation.

## What RME Is NOT

• Not a commodity validator
  We do not just upload lists, run automated checks, and dump raw statuses back at you.
  We process large lists, but we take responsibility for interpretation, risk, and next steps.
  The difference is not volume. It is accountability.
• Not a cheap tool
• Not automation without accountability
• Not a growth hack
• Not cold outreach software

We do not promise:

• Instant fixes
• Magic deliverability
• Guaranteed opens
