## What the SOS Email Hotline Is

The SOS Email Hotline is an open access place to ask questions about **anything related to email and deliverability**.

People use it to:

• Ask beginner questions about email
• Learn how to get into email as a career
• Understand list validation
• Fix authentication
• Troubleshoot ESP issues
• Sanity check strategies
• Talk through problems

It is not limited to crisis situations.

It is also included as an optional call with list cleaning.

When used with list cleaning, it often goes deeper:

• Root cause analysis
• Pattern recognition
• Strategic diagnosis
• Reading and understanding reports
• Explaining what metrics actually mean
• How to monitor deliverability long term
• What to track vs what to ignore
• How to spot early warning signs
• How to interpret ESP dashboards
• How to build internal reporting
• Connecting list quality to revenue
• Translating data into decisions
• Helping them choose the right tools
• Pressure testing their strategy
• Sanity checking growth tactics
• Teaching them how to self-diagnose

But the core promise is simple:

**If you have an email question, this is where you ask it.**

## Session Format

Officially: 30 minutes

Reality: often runs longer

Why:
